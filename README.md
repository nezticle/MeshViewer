# Qt Quick 3D Mesh file Viewer

Application for viewing the contents of .mesh files used by Qt Quick 3D. These .mesh files contain the static mesh geometry data used by Qt Quick 3D models. These files are normally generated by the Balsam conditioning tool provided by Qt Quick 3D, but sometimes it is necessary to debug these .mesh files, so this viewer parses those and shows the content.
